## Description 

This website is just an easy project where you can add something to an array. For example when you want to create a shopping list, just enter every wanted item in input and click “dodaj” button. A list is created with each item separated by a comma. I used JS, HTML and a little bit of CSS.

## Usage 

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wikaobl/add-to-array
```

Next, install dependencies

```bash
cd add-to-array
npm install
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run
```

After successfully starting the project, open your web browser and go to the specified URL http://localhost:3000
